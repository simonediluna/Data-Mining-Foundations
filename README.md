# Data-Mining-Fundations
An academic project I carried out for the data mining course. The project consists in exercises requiring the use of data mining tools for analysis of data. Exercises include: data understanding, clustering analysis, classification and pattern mining. Specifically, the tasks required were as follows:
* Data Understanding & Preparation:
  - Data Semantics.
  - Distribution of the variables and statistics.
  - Assessing data quality.
  - Variable transformations.
  - Pairwise correlations and eventual elimination of variables.
* Clustering:
  - Clustering analysis by K-Means.
  - Analysis by density-based clustering.
  - Analysis by hierarchical clustering.
  - Comparison.
* Classification:
  - Classification by Decision Trees.
  - Classification by K-NN.
  - Comparison.
* Pattern Mining:
  - Frequent Pattern extraction.
  - Discuss Frequent Pattern.
  - Association Rules extraction.
  - Discuss Association rules.
  - Exploit the most useful extracted rules.

# About the data set
The Glasgow Norms are a set of normative ratings for 5,553 English words on nine psycholinguistic dimensions: arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition, semantic size, and gender association. The data were collected by presenting the corpus of 5,553 words to participants in lists of either 101 or 150 words. For each list, participants rated words separately on all nine dimensions. A total of 829 unique participants took part in the rating studies. The participants were native English speakers from the University of Glasgow community and were recruited opportunistically.
